## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ node_modules/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ structures/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ utils/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pages/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ api/
â”‚   â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ delete/
â”‚   â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ info/
â”‚   â”‚       â””â”€â”€ upsert/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ env.d.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ .env.example
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

## Configuration

To run the CDN locally:

1. Clone this repository to a local folder
2. Copy the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`

    ```

    QUALITY=80
    SECRET_KEY=''

    # Hostname and Ports

    ```

4. Install dependencies with `yarn`
5. Run `yarn dev` to start the Astro development server
